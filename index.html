      <h3>Web security</h3>
      <p>As a website owner, it is essential to understand the potential web security threats that your website may face and take appropriate measures to protect against them. There are three main types of web security threats that you should be aware of: cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and cross-site request forgery (CSFR).
        Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of attack where attackers inject malicious code into a website, which can then be executed by unexpected visitors. This can lead to data theft or other types of malicious activities. To prevent XSS attacks, I would recommend that you implement input validation techniques, sanitize user input, and use content security policies. 
        SQL injection is another type of web security threat that involves injecting malicious SQL code into a websiteâ€™s database. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or even take control of the website. To protect against SQL injection, I would recommend that you use prepared statements and parameterized queries to sanitize user inputs. 
        Cross-site request forgery(CSRF) is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a user into performing an action that they did not intend to perform, such as transferring money or deleting important data. To prevent CSRF attacks, I would implement XSRF tokens, which verify that the request is coming from the user and not an attacker.
